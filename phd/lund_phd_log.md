* Research: My current research focuses consist of two main areas of interest.: 
: First, I examine the drivers, determinants, and implications of missionary work in Sub Saharan Africa. While exploring missionary, colonial archives, and micro-level church records, I derive insights on the demographic dynamics as well as the long-term effects of early education and health care efforts for Sub Saharan Africa since the 19th century. The aim of this research is to create a more profound understanding of historical demographic, educational, and medical dynamics in Africa, which provides a necessary component in the study of the present population boom and development process.: 
: Second, I assess both the value added and the global greenhouse gas emissions embodied in trade within globally fragmented production processes from the late 20th century onwards. In doing so, I have specialized in the analysis of global value chains with the use of input-output analysis.: Teaching: Qualifications: :

* Research areas and keywords: Business Administration, 
* Research: My PhD-project focus on the state of clinical medical research in Sweden and the organization of university-hospitals, with an emphasis on the situation for physician-scientists in their role as translators between scientific research and clinical work. This includes mapping out the various career paths that exists within the university-hospital, and how the circumstances changes as the career develops. Through an in-depth qualitative study, I take a micro approach to better understand the challenges they experience, with a special emphasis on the dual roles that they have and how this impacts their situation. Theoretically, I mainly use aspects from professional and career theory, such as socialization, role transitions, identity, and liminality. Influenced by the Chicago school of sociology and Stephen Barley, I argue that by studying the individual career we can, in addition to better understand the situation for the individual actors, provide a more complete picture of the organization as a whole.  :

* Research areas and keywords: Economics, 
* Research: I will briefly describe my research topics. I am focusing on three subjects: capital structure of the firms, bank-firm relationships and the connection between stock liquidity and credit risk. : 
: My first paper analyzes the effect of bank finance on the firms on bad times. The hypothesis is that the financially distressed firms having more bank debt in their capital structure go through the recession smoother than financially distressed firms having less bank debt and borrowing more from the bond market.: 
: In my second paper, I aim to analyze the effect of being listed in index funds on the cost of capital of a firm and its capital structure. The index funds and their roles in the financial markets are a discussion issue in Sweden nowadays. I will examine the firms’ capital structure before being listed in or after de-listed from the index funds empirically. : 
: The third research topic that I am focusing on is the effect of stock liquidity on CDS spreads. The hypothesis is that there is a link between stock market and CDS market; this relationship helps us predict the movement of CDS spreads by analyzing stock liquidity in the developed stock market. : 
: I am also interested in entrepreneurship. I am planning to study the growth of small entreprises which show a high growth and the role of financing in their growths.: Teaching: I have teaching experience as a teaching assistant at master level courses in financial economics. The courses that I teach on a regular basis are: "Foundations of Finance" and "Financial Valuation and Risk Management". I am the sole teacher in the exercise classes of these courses. Besides, I am assisting the main lecturer in the main clourse lessons. I am providing help to students for their questions regarding to my exercise classes and main lectures in the regular office hours throughout the semester. I am also teaching mathematics to master students in a 3-week intensive course at the beginning of each academic year. The aim of this course is to provide students with an adequate level of mathematical knowldege for the topics in main courses in finance and economics. Besides my teaching activities, I have some administrative works such as being an administrator in the exam office of the Departments of Economics where students from both master and undergraduate levels can review their exams and make appeals about their grades. Moreover, I sometimes participate in organizing some seminars or workshops (Young Scholars Nordic Finance Workshop, Nov. 26-27, 2015 Lund, Sweden).:

: Doctoral project description:: 
: The objective of the project is to understand a state's right to regulate in international economic law, specifically international investment law, through the use of policy measures meant to advance sustainable development. In doing so, the project identifies the substantive and procedural meaning of sustainable development in international economic law and compares it to the way that sustainable development policy is defined and assessed by the United Nations, with the UN 2030 Agenda at its core. To understand these different aspects of the nexus between international economic law and sustainable development policy, the project looks at SDGs 8 and 17, which serve as gateways to the wider development frameworks of the United Nations and the World Bank, as well as select methods in development, structural and environmental economics. The project is designed to strengthen UN approaches to development policy assessment, better integrate sustainable development into international economic law practice and more closely unite them in both practice and research.:

* Research areas and keywords: Economics, 
* Research: My main research interests are behavioral economics and industrial organization. The psychological factors that affect economic decisions are important to understand and this is increasingly being acknowledged in economic research. How firms interact is sometimes a different question, in which I study market structures and firm behavior as a response to competition. In one study I test if firms are more likely to cheat when competition is fiercer. I test this hypothesis using well-established quasi-experimental methods. I believe in empirical and experimental research methods to not only test hypotheses, but to develop and improve theory. : Societal impact: Some selected news articles about my study (in collaboration with Sven-Olov Daunfeldt and Niklas Rudholm) of how music affects consumer behavior in an experiment in fast food restaurants::

* Research: I am a PhD student in Entrepreneurship at the Sten K Johnson Centre for Entrepreneurship. My research is at the intersection of organizations and Entrepreneurship. Specifically, my research examines the impact of organizational contexts such as bureaucracy and wage inequality on an employees propensity to venture into entrepreneurship, specifically looking at the careers of knowledge workers from the science and technology labour force. I move away from conventional research by not only examining entrepreneurial entry but also entrepreneurial outcomes, namely, entrepreneurial performance and entrepreneurial exit. I examine my research through the sociology of entrepreneurship.: 
: Methodologically, my research uses quantitaive methods drawing on Swedish labour market provided by Statistics Sweden (SCB). My long terms goal is to apply computational social science methods such as machine learning, Agent Based Modeling and network science into entrepreneurship research.:

* Doctoral Student
* Research areas and keywords: Economic History, 
* Research: My main research areas concerns development economics, approached from an economic history perspective. Within this I focus on the role of structural transformation and the agricultural sector in development and in the macro-economy, in Sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically I study the role that the agricultural sector has played in Ethiopia's rapid economic growth in the last two decades, during the country's implementation of an Agricultural Development Led Industrialization (ADLI)-strategy since 1993. :

* Research: My research focusses on long-term intergenerational mobility trends in Sweden. To study these I make use of linked Swedish censuses covering the period 1850-current (starting with the 1880 census). I am specifically interested in multigenerational mobility, class heterogeneity in mobility, the relationship between intergenerational mobility and gender (through homogamy and female labor market participation), and the relationship between economic and social mobility (specifically, the ‘class pay gap’). The Swedish individual-level census data lends itself well to assess and compare different methodologies in mobility measurement, as well as theoretical notions on the development of mobility over time.:

* Doctoral Student
* Research areas and keywords: Business Administration, Sustainability, CSR, Communication, Marketing, Retail, Brand Management, Legitimacy, 
* Research: My research is mainly about how business organizations communicate sustainability, and how such communication contributes to shaping the meanings we attach to the concept. Being affiliated with the Centre for Retail Research at Lund University, I am primarily interested in how the transition towards sustainable development is unfolding over time in a retail environment (and not), as seen from a communication perspective. : 
: All talk about sustainability (and there is a lot of talk about it!) will contribute to shaping the meanings we attach to the concept, and in extension shape how we understand and “do” sustainability. Understanding how sustainability talk is constructed and legitimized in various social contexts can therefore help us map and guide the ongoing transition towards more sustainable development. : 
: That is why I in my PhD-project have set out to explore how sustainability discourse becomes a legitimate and integrated aspect of retailing among employees of a retail firm, what it is that might drive and hinder such endeavors, and what this might imply for the meaning and management of both retailing and sustainability. In short, how retail employees are socialized into caring about some versions of what sustainability might mean.   :
